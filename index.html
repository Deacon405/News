      <h3>Be Like Bill</h3>
      <p>This 2015-2016 meme is a raging virus: It has propagated faster than any other internet meme.

Bill is a stick person illustration, with white space left for captioning. The version pictured here is the Bill with the hat/toque headdress. You will also see versions of stick person Bill sitting at a computer.

The irresistible appeal of Bill is that it is a powerful passive-aggressive way to make public judgments about other people's life choices. If you want to comment on something you disagree with, the innocuous Bill stick figure is an excellent vehicle to transmit your message.

In the same way that Kermit and his teacup have become a tool for highlighting and criticizing others, Bill is a wildfire hit with anyone who wants to feel morally superior to others.

        <h3>Rickrolled Baby!</h3>
        <p>This prankster meme refuses to die! 'Rickrolling' is when people pretend to send critical business email links in emails but they actually send links to Rick Astley music videos from the 1980s.</p>

         <h3>But That's None of My Business</h3>
         <p>While the imagery seems innocent enough, this recent meme is used to openly pass sarcastic judgment on someone, much like Be Like Bill. When you think someone is an idiot for some life decision he or she has made, you can post a photo of Kermit drinking tea, along with the phrase 'but that's none of my business.' The memorable muppet image will help the message gnaw on the person's brain for a while, and remind them that they've been judged. </p>

           <h3>U Mad Bro?</h3>
           <p>'U mad bro' is arguably a trifecta meme because it is simultaneously a meme, a conversational expression, and a form of trolling/flaming all at once. This meme expression allegedly started in 2003 when hip-hop musician Cam'Ron engaged in a heated discussion with talk show host Bill O'Reilly over how his music affected children. Over the last decade, 'u mad bro' has grown into a daily conversation term for the millennial generation, and spawned several versions of itself as 'he mad', 'she mad', 'why you mad tho', and more.</p>

           <h3>The New Old Spice Guy</h3>
           <p>These preposterous commercials are exactly that: preposterous. Yet these commercials have a real charm that makes women grin and men guffaw. Take a look at the number of hits that these Old Spice commercials get on YouTube. That should give you a sense of how viral these commercials are.</p>

             <h3>Doge! Much Wow, Such Fun.</h3>
             <p>Since 2005, 'doge' has been a subculture meme thanks to the Homestar Runner puppet show. In this episode, the Homestar character nicknames his cohort, Strong Bad, as "d-o-g-e".

Today, doge is a photograph meme commonly attached to photos of Shiba Inu dogs, combined with comic sans font and the use of bad grammar with comedic monologue text. Doge has also become the name for a new type of digital currency called 'Dogecoins'.

'Doge' has two common pronunciations: as a rhyme with 'rogue', or pronounced as 'dohj'.</p>
